# 🔄 Restart the Jupyter Kernel

If you're seeing old cached output like `TRACE ID: no_trace`, you need to restart the kernel and re-run the cells.

## How to Restart the Kernel

### In Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab:
1. Click **Kernel** → **Restart Kernel**
2. Or click **Kernel** → **Restart & Run All**

### In VS Code:
1. Click the **"Restart"** button at the top of the notebook
2. Or use Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → "Jupyter: Restart Kernel"

### In Cursor:
1. Click the **kernel name** at the top right of the notebook
2. Select **"Restart"**

## After Restarting

Pull the latest code:
```bash
cd /Users/ahmed.bilal/Desktop/gateway-oss
git pull origin main
```

Then in the notebook:
1. Run **Cell 1** (Setup imports - will reload the module)
2. Run **Cell 2** (API key setup)
3. Run the rest of the cells
