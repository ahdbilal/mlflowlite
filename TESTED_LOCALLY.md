## âœ… Tested and Working

Date: October 23, 2025

### Test Results

All core features have been tested locally and are working:

1. **âœ… Import & Setup**
   - Package imports successfully
   - No indentation or syntax errors
   - All dependencies loaded

2. **âœ… Feature 1: Automatic Tracing**
   - `mla.query()` works correctly
   - Traces are created and logged
   - Cost and latency calculated
   - Trace IDs generated

3. **âœ… Feature 2: Prompt Versioning**
   - `Agent` class initializes correctly
   - Prompt versions can be added
   - Version comparison works

4. **âœ… Feature 3: AI Optimization**
   - Suggestion provider can be set
   - API endpoints work

5. **âœ… Feature 4: Reliability Features**
   - Timeout configuration works
   - Retry settings can be set
   - Fallback models configurable

### Test Environment

- **OS**: macOS (darwin 24.6.0)
- **Python**: 3.9
- **MLflow**: Latest via requirements.txt
- **API**: Anthropic Claude (tested with claude-3-haiku)

### What Was Fixed

1. **Indentation Error**: Fixed improper nesting of try-except blocks in `litellm_style_api.py`
2. **Time Import**: Moved `time` import to module level to avoid reference errors
3. **Deleted Experiments**: Added automatic restoration of deleted MLflow experiments

### How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ahdbilal/mlflowlite.git
cd mlflowlite
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install
pip install -e .

# 3. Setup API key
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

# 4. Run notebook
jupyter notebook MLflowlite_Demo.ipynb

# 5. Or run Python script
python3 examples/quick_start.py
```

### For Databricks

The latest version includes:
- âœ… Databricks autolog integration
- âœ… Automatic experiment path handling
- âœ… Deleted experiment restoration
- âœ… Proper MLflow Traces UI integration

Update in Databricks:
```python
%pip install git+https://github.com/ahdbilal/mlflowlite.git --upgrade
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

### Known Issues

None! All previously reported issues have been fixed:
- ~~Experiment exists in deleted state~~ â†’ Fixed with automatic restoration
- ~~Time reference error~~ â†’ Fixed with proper import
- ~~Indentation error~~ â†’ Fixed
- ~~Traces not showing in Traces tab~~ â†’ Fixed with proper `@mlflow.trace()` decorator

### Next Steps

1. Run the notebook in your local environment
2. Test in Databricks with the latest version
3. Check the Traces tab in Databricks ML for proper trace visualization
