      "  2. Provide more detailed troubleshooting steps the user can take, like clearing browser cache/cookies, trying a different browser, checking if others have the same issue, etc. A systematic debugging process would improve helpfulness.\n",
      "  3. The response looks concise and to-the-point already at 124 tokens, striking a good balance of detail and brevity. Aim to keep responses in the 75-150 token range for good efficiency.\n",
      "  4. Latency is pretty good at under 3 seconds. Optimizing the prompt with techniques like zero/few-shot prompts, using a smaller model for this task, or fine-tuning could potentially shave off some time.\n",
      "  5. Include an instruction in the prompt to ask clarifying questions if more information is needed to diagnose the issue. This could improve response accuracy.\n",
      "  6. Provide a troubleshooting framework or steps in the prompt for the model to follow, to generate more systematic and helpful responses. For example: check permissions, test other browsers, escalate to IT, etc.\n",
      "  7. Experiment with different prompt variations and see which ones produce the best quality responses most efficiently. Iterate to optimize prompts based on real interactions.\n",
