      "  3. To improve speed and reduce cost, try shortening the prompt by focusing on essential details like the error message, when it started, and the browser used. Remove less critical info.\n",
      "  4. Experiment with using a smaller, faster model for the initial response, and only use the larger model if more detailed troubleshooting is needed after gathering more context.\n",
      "  5. Restructure the prompt to put the most important information first, like: \"A manager is getting a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access the analytics dashboard for the past 2 days. Using Chrome version 120. What troubleshooting steps do you recommend?\"\n",
      "  6. Add a prompt instruction telling the model to provide a concise initial response with clear troubleshooting steps and when to escalate to IT. This can guide the model to give more actionable suggestions.\n",
